Too many gigs, needing a database and then some magic to happen ! With the use of the sum of all my practices in Vanilla Javascript, React.js, Express.js, Redux, Socket.io & PostgreSQL. CRUD operations, Google Maps Api, AWS Cloud Services. User Live interactions through chatting, commenting and photo gallery contributions, made the Old School way !",
